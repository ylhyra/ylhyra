# Project overview

## Content

Content is stored as Markdown files in a folder named `ylhyra_content` that must be a sibling directory of the code directory. See the [`ylhyra_content`](https://github.com/ylhyra/ylhyra_content/tree/content) git repository.

### Content files and translation data files

The content files are stored in the `not_data` directory. In the `data` directory their associated translation data files can be found.

The directory structure can be arbitrary, the only thing that matters is the title of the markdown document given in its YAML header.

Translation data files correspond to the content file by their `title` value, an article titled `X` has the associated translation data file `Data:X`. (This naming system is a vestige of when the content was stored in a MediaWiki repository.)
