- Deck → Row → Card
  - **Deck** – A `deck` is a collection of `terms`.
  - **Row** – A `row` is a single row in the user's input file, e.g. "hola = hello".
  - **Card** – Each row can have two `cards` (i.e. flashcard sides) that each teaches a specific direction, e.g. "hola → hello" and "hello → hola".
- A deck can have multiple folders, which contain links to terms.
