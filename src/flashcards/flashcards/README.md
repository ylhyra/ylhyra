* Deck → Item → Card
* **Deck** – A `deck` is a collection of `terms`.
* **Term** – A `term` (should possibly be renamed `item` or `entry`) is a single piece of information, e.g. "hola = hello", i.e. a single row in the user's input file.
* **Card** – Each item can have two `cards` (i.e. flashcard sides) that each teaches a specific direction, e.g. "hola → hello" and "hello → hola".
* A deck can have multiple folders, which contain links to terms.
