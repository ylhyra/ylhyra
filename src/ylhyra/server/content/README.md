# Content

Content is stored at the [ylhyra_content](https://github.com/ylhyra/ylhyra_content) repository on the `content` branch.

This content must be processed with `npm run links` to create a `links.json` file.

This directory compiles that content and makes it accessible. It sends each document to be compiled at the `ylhyra/documents/compile` directory.
